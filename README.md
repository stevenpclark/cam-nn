# cam-nn
Test app to demonstrate the benefit of adding camera information as an additional input to deep neural-network-based image classifiers.

## Objectives
- Determine if image classification accuracy improves after injecting camera geometry metadata alongside the pixel data
- Figure out where in the [GoogLeNet](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842) architecture to insert the camera info
- Continue building familiarity with [convolutional neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) and [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)
